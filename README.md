# neovim-tmux-config
Welcome to my Neovim and tmux configuration repository! These configurations are tailored for my workflow in Computer Science coursework and projects. I compose homeworks in Latex with VimTex, and use the nvim-tmux setup for most of my programming. This setup is custom-built and is continuously being refined.
